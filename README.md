Implemented an interface for buffs (effects that give the player +% / -% or +value or -value to characteristics). Written using simple mathematics, the number of buffs can be infinite.

Implemented the game Dota 2: 1x6 in Minecraft, exactly the same. Including: item system, item creation system, monster system with updated (non-default Minecraft) intelligence, tower system, and other systems from the original game that I can't remember.

Implemented Stardew Valley + Cookie Clicker in Minecraft, where players have to buy plants, take care of animals, and overall just develop their farm. Buildings, cultures, animals, and much more - all of this was written in three months. MMO + Stardew Valley + Cookie Clicker = a game that was distributed on local worlds (worlds stored in memory and weigh nothing, but not with SlimeWorldManager, although I dealt with SLIME-format worlds) held up to 1000+ players simultaneously.
